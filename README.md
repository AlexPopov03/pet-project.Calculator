Calculator

This is my first pet-project

It will help you to count not simple math tasks

The calculator can multiply, divide, add and subtract. You can also put values in parentheses and count not integer numbers

The button "C" will delete all values in form
The button "arrow" will delete 1 last value in form
The button "=" will give you the result

Pleasant use!
